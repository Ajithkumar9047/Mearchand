cd your_project
# Install dependencies:
Install Python dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run Behave tests:
# Execute Behave tests using the following command:
behave --without report
test_run- with report
This command runs all the feature files (*.feature) located in the features/ directory.

# View test reports:
After running tests, check the HTML test reports generated in the reports/ directory.

# Running Specific Scenarios
You can run specific scenarios using Behave tags. For example, to run scenarios tagged as @smoke:
behave --tags=@smoke
